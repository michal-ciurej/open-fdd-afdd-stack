# BACnet Graph Context

This document captures the BACnet-specific context that the automated testing repo should preserve for future clones, future labs, and future researchers.

The goal is simple: **do not rely on tribal knowledge**.

## Why this context matters

In live HVAC monitoring, the Open-FDD knowledge graph is not just metadata. It is the bridge between:

- BACnet devices and point addressing
- semantic equipment typing (AHU, VAV, zone, plant, meter, etc.)
- rule applicability
- FDD algorithm selection
- future optimization logic

If we know, from the graph:
- which BACnet device a point belongs to
- which object identifier is being scraped
- which Brick/equipment type the point belongs to
- which Open-FDD rule inputs are mapped

then we know much more than "the point exists". We know which fault rules should fire, and later we can know which optimization or supervisory logic should apply.

## What must be discoverable from the graph

For BACnet-backed verification, the test harness should always be able to retrieve or verify:

1. **BACnet device inventory**
   - device instance
   - device address
   - device object presence in the graph

2. **BACnet point addressing**
   - object identifier
   - point label / object-name alignment
   - point-to-device membership

3. **Equipment semantic context**
   - AHU / VAV / zone / plant / building associations
   - Brick class of the point
   - whether the point is marked for polling

4. **Rule relevance context**
   - which YAML fault rules are active
   - what `rule_input` mappings exist for the point/equipment
   - what rolling-window parameters matter for that rule

5. **Operational intent**
   - whether the point is used for FDD only
   - whether the point is useful for future optimization / supervisory control
   - whether the point is operator-facing or only diagnostic

## Live system interpretation

In a future live deployment, this BACnet graph context should support three increasingly valuable questions:

### 1. What is connected?
- Which BACnet devices exist?
- Which points are actually mapped?
- Which points are being polled?

### 2. What kind of HVAC system is this?
- Is the equipment an AHU, VAV, boiler, chiller, plant, or meter?
- What topology relationships exist?
- Which points matter for diagnostics vs operations?

### 3. What analysis should apply?
- Which FDD rules should run?
- Which optimization or supervisory algorithms are sensible here?
- Which results are expected if the fake BACnet devices deliberately enter a fault state?

This is the beginning of a machine-readable engineering context, not just a UI convenience.

## Existing SPARQL assets in this repo

Relevant reusable queries already exist in `sparql/`, especially:

- `04_bacnet_devices.sparql`
- `08_bacnet_telemetry_points.sparql`
- `05_brick_rule_mapping.sparql`
- `10_ahus.sparql`
- `13_vav_boxes.sparql`
- `19_hvac_equipment.sparql`
- `21_points.sparql`

## BACnet telemetry query already used by the repo

The repo already contains a useful baseline query in `sparql/08_bacnet_telemetry_points.sparql`.

It returns:
- `point_label`
- `brick_class`
- `unit`
- `device_instance`
- `device_address`
- `object_identifier`

That is a strong starting point for proving that BACnet addressing is present in the graph and matched to polling points.

## Current live-environment status (2026-03-22)

Attempted live Open-FDD API query:
- `POST http://192.168.204.16:8000/data-model/sparql`
- Result: `401 Missing or invalid Authorization header`

Meaning:
- the live query path exists
- this machine currently does not have the correct `OFDD_API_KEY` available for backend SPARQL access
- the right next step is to load the same auth secret used by the Open-FDD stack so graph validation can run non-interactively

## BACnet scraper / DIY gateway context

The BACnet scraper gateway OpenAPI was reachable at:
- `http://192.168.204.16:8080/openapi.json`

Notable capabilities exposed there include:
- `client_whois_range`
- `client_point_discovery`
- `client_read_property`
- `client_read_multiple`
- `client_supervisory_logic_checks`
- `client_read_point_priority_array`

This means the test repo can validate not only that Open-FDD has graph references, but also that the BACnet-side source system is queryable for independent verification.

## Engineering direction

This repo should evolve toward a formal verification chain:

1. fake BACnet device emits deterministic fault pattern
2. BACnet gateway can independently read that device/point state
3. Open-FDD graph confirms the point is modeled and addressable
4. Open-FDD scrape path lands the telemetry
5. active YAML rules and rolling windows imply a specific fault expectation
6. Open-FDD fault APIs/UI confirm the result

That chain is the real standard for trustworthy FDD validation.

## Where this context is saved

This context is intentionally stored in the repo at:
- `docs/bacnet_graph_context.md`

Humans cloning the repo should be able to find it immediately, review it, and extend it without asking the original authors what was "meant."
