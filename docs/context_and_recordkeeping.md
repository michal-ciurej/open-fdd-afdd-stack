# Context and Recordkeeping

This repo is intended to preserve engineering context in visible files, not in private chat memory alone.

## How OpenClaw saves context here

OpenClaw should record durable context in repo documentation when the context is:

- important for future clones of the repo
- important for repeatable testing or operations
- useful to future engineers, operators, or researchers
- more durable than a one-off chat summary

That means the preferred storage location is **versioned markdown in `docs/`**.

## What belongs in repo documentation

Examples of context worth saving:

- BACnet graph assumptions
- rule-verification plans
- overnight review procedure
- PR review heuristics
- known environment limitations
- lessons learned while validating Open-FDD
- future live-HVAC monitoring and optimization context

## What should not stay only in chat

These should not live only in chat history:

- validation strategy
- reasoning about the three operational states
- recurring review workflows
- how frontend/backend/log correlation is supposed to be checked
- how fake BACnet behavior maps to expected FDD outcomes

## Current context documents

Humans should start here:

- `docs/operational_states.md`
- `docs/overnight_review.md`
- `docs/bacnet_graph_context.md`
- `docs/ai_pr_review_playbook.md`
- `docs/testing_plan.md`
- `docs/context_and_recordkeeping.md`

## Dashboard operation note

The local dashboard in `dashboard/` is intended to be **run by an agent on request**.

The expected human workflow is simple:
- ask the agent to start the dashboard
- ask the agent to restart it if the local server dies
- ask the agent to evolve the dashboard when new panes or metrics are needed

The human is not expected to manually maintain the dashboard serving process.
The code should remain in the repo, and the agent should handle the lightweight local serving step when asked.

## Why this exists

If this repo is cloned elsewhere, or if different agents/humans work on it later, the important engineering context should still be easy to find.

The goal is simple:

- save context in the repo
- make it visible to humans
- make it reusable by future agents
- reduce dependence on tribal knowledge
- keep the tooling portable enough to run from other machines against other Open-FDD servers
